ðŸ“± Gigabank flutter assignment - Jake King-Lee

This is my submission for the the Gigabank tech task.

I started this project by cloning the repo from Gitlab.
I was originally thinking of using `stacked` for this project, my favourite Flutter state management package, however I decided that I would use `bloc` instead because it is relatively simple task.

I tried to ensure that my UI matches as close to the screenshot as possible within the 4 hour timeframe.


Things I would like to improve on:
- Improve the UI on the `HomePage`
- Finish the `AddressValidatorService` so that we can actually validate that the address entered exists, and display this to the user.
- Move the strings from `strings.dart` to a json file and load on app launch.
- Add unit, widget, and bloc tests.
